Introduction

This project showcases a simulated Ternary Computing System, created in Python. Unlike traditional binary systems that use two states (0 and 1), this system operates on three states: -1, 0, and 1. Exploring ternary logic lays the groundwork for new computing architectures that could provide notable gains in efficiency and information density. The project includes a complete CPU simulation, a study of ternary neural networks, and a hardware simulation model to measure performance.

Core Concepts of Ternary Logic

At the heart of this project is a balanced ternary number system, where each "trit" (ternary digit) can have one of three values: TNEG (-1), TZERO (0), or TPOS (1). This system is used throughout the CPU's design, influencing data representation, logic gates, and arithmetic operations.

Key components of the ternary logic are defined as follows:

- Ternary Signal: The TernarySignal class represents the three possible states and automatically converts a representation of (0, 1, 2) to the balanced form (-1, 0, 1).

- Ternary Gates: Basic logical operations are implemented as static methods in the TernaryGate class. TAND returns the minimum of two trits, TOR returns the maximum, and TXOR uses a custom truth table. These gates are the foundation of the CPU's Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).

Python

# Examples of Ternary Logic
def ternary_and(a, b): return min(a, b)
def ternary_or(a, b): return max(a, b)
def ternary_xor(a, b): return (a - b) % 3

CPU Architecture and Components

The simulated CPU consists of several basic components, each designed to operate within the ternary framework.

Program Counter (PC)

The ProgramCounter keeps track of the address of the next instruction to be executed. It has a maximum value of 242, corresponding to a 5-trit addressing scheme (3^5 - 1). This component handles instruction sequencing and supports unconditional jumps.

Register Set

The RegisterSet offers three general-purpose registers (R0, R1, R2) for storing temporary values. The write method ensures that values remain within the ternary range [0, 1, 2] by using the modulo 3 operator.

Ternary Memory

The TernaryMemory class simulates a memory system with 243 addresses (3^5), matching the PC's addressable space. Each memory location can hold a single ternary digit (0, 1, or 2).

Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

The TernaryALU carries out arithmetic and logic operations. It supports basic ternary gates (TAND, TOR, TXOR), as well as addition (ADD) and subtraction (SUB) modulo 3. It also includes a CMP (compare) function and manages zero and carry flags.

Pipelined CPU Implementation

To boost performance, a pipelined CPU architecture is implemented in the TernaryPipelinedCPU class. This design breaks instruction execution into five stages, similar to a traditional binary pipeline:

- IF (Instruction Fetch): Fetches the instruction from the program memory.

- ID (Instruction Decode): Decodes the instruction and reads source registers.

- EX (Execute): Executes the operation using the ALU.

- MEM (Memory Access): Accesses memory for LOAD or STORE operations.

- WB (Write Back): Writes the result back to a destination register.

The pipeline includes logic for detecting and managing data hazards, ensuring proper execution order, even when an instruction depends on the result of a previous instruction that is still running. A forwarding_values function is included to pass results from the EX or MEM stages directly to the ID stage, reducing stalls.

Ternary Neural Network

This project extends the idea of ternary computing to machine learning by implementing a neural network (TernaryGateNN) that works on ternary data. The network architecture is a multi-layer perceptron with four hidden layers.

Key features of the neural network implementation:

- Activation Functions: It uses Leaky ReLU for hidden layers and Softmax for the output layer.

- Loss and Regularization: The network is trained using a mix of cross-entropy loss and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.

- Training and Metrics: The training loop includes an adaptive learning rate and metrics tracking, such as cross-entropy loss, L2 loss, gradient norm, and training time.

Hardware Simulation

A dedicated TernaryHardwareSimulator is included to provide a high-level estimation of a ternary chip's performance. The simulator uses three models to estimate key physical properties for different ternary operations:

- Power Model: Estimates power consumption for operations like ADD, SUB, AND, OR, NOT, and MUL.

- Timing Model: Estimates the timing delays for each operation.

- Area Model: Estimates the required silicon area for the functional units.

Using these models, the simulator can benchmark and compare the relative performance of different ternary operations and configurations.
