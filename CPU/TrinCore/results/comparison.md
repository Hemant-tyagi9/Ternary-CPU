Generated on 2025-08-14 11:46:14

## Executive Summary

This report compares the performance of binary and ternary CPU architectures implemented in Python simulation.

### Key Findings
- **Binary CPU** shows faster execution for basic operations
- **Ternary CPU** offers 1.58x higher data density per symbol
- **Binary CPU**: Traditional binary logic with proven performance
- **Ternary CPU**: Enhanced data density with ternary logic (trits)

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Binary CPU | Ternary CPU | Unit |
|--------|------------|-------------|------|
| Execution Time | 3.058800211874768e-05 | 6.515700079035014e-05 | seconds |
| Cycles | 24 | 9 | cycles |
| Memory Usage | 2224 | 1048 | bytes |
| Data Density | 1.0000 | 1.5850 | bits/symbol |
| Throughput | 784621 | 138128 | ops/sec |
| Accuracy | 100.0 | 100.0 | % |

## Architecture Details

### Binary CPU
- Uses traditional 2-state logic (0, 1)
- Optimized for modern hardware
- Well-established instruction set
- 8 registers, 256 memory locations

### Ternary CPU
- Uses 3-state logic (0, 1, 2)
- Higher information density per symbol
- Novel instruction encoding
- 9 registers, 243 memory locations (3^5)
- Potential for reduced circuit complexity

## Test Programs

Both CPUs executed comparable test programs with:
- Load immediate operations
- Arithmetic operations (ADD)
- Logic operations (AND, OR, XOR)
- Control flow (HALT)

## Ternary Logic Operations

The ternary CPU implements the following logic:
- **ADD**: (a + b) mod 3
- **SUB**: (a - b) mod 3
- **AND**: min(a, b)
- **OR**: max(a, b)
- **XOR**: (a - b) mod 3 if a != b, else 0

## Performance Analysis

- **Speed Ratio**: Ternary is 2.13x the execution time of binary
- **Memory Ratio**: Ternary uses 0.47x the memory of binary
- **Cycle Ratio**: Ternary uses 0.38x the cycles of binary
- **Data Density Advantage**: 1.585x more information per symbol
